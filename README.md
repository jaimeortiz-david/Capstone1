# Capstone Project 1

Using deep learning techniques my objective is to aid and automate the process of species identification which will enhance our abilities to control invasive plants.

## Data

The data that i will use for this project comes from a curated dataset provided by kaggle and described as follows:
The data set contains pictures taken in a Brazilian national forest. In some of the pictures there is Hydrangea,â€‹ a beautiful invasive species original of Asia. Based on the training pictures and the labels provided, the participant should predict the presence of the invasive species in the testing set of pictures.

## Methods

My approach to solve this problem will be based on deep learning algorithms. I will use a subset of the images provided to train the algorithm (Convolutional Neural Networks) and test for its accuracy.
